Capture-the-flag, or CTF for short, is a series of three hacking competitions.
These competitions require you to break some kind of security measures to
obtain a secret piece of information -- the flag.

The first of the series was on November 29, 2018. The second of the series is
scheduled for

Come to the kick-off in room 3-115 of Keller Hall, which runs from 4PM to 8PM
CST, or participate online -- the event runs through the weekend.

What is CTF?
============

CTF, short for capture-the-flag, is a cybersecurity competition in which
participants try to evade security protections on certain exploitable targets to
obtain secret information known as flags.


What do I need to know?
=======================

You don't need to have any background in computer science or programming to
participate in the very first CTF, but we do want you to come with an open mind
ready to learn. The competition will be covering topics such as analyzing
programs for bugs, reverse engineering, basic web technologies, cyberforensics,
cryptographic techniques and more!

Technology-wise, you'll definitely need access to a computer, preferably running
some flavor of Linux. For this very first competition, we're not going to put
many challenges that absolutely require you to have Linux, but if you don't,
consider these options:

 - Downloading a VM (virtual machine) running a Linux image. Virtual machines
are the most straightforward way to run Linux on a machine that doesn't have it.
It also gives the option to interact with the virtual Linux machine using a
mouse, which is great for people who aren't too good with the command line yet.

 - Windows Subsystem for Linux (for Windows users). The Windows Subsystem for
Linux (WSL for short) is a feature that comes with newer editions of Windows
10 that hackily runs a Linux "subsystem" within Windows at native speeds. For
general cases, this is a good option, but some lower-level programs may crash
or cause blue screens.

 - Mac (for Mac users). Mac is a UNIX-based operating system, so many scripting
technologies play friendly with Mac as well. Note that executables compiled for
Linux will not work on Mac, so if you encounter a situation where you need to
run a binary executable, you may want to consider a different option.

 - CSE Labs. All students under the College of Science and Engineering are
given access to the lab computers, which are running Ubuntu. Although you will
not have root privileges, it's a great way to run or test scripts. Be mindful
of what you run, and remember you are on a public machine!

Other than the environment you use, it's a good idea to have a solid internet
connection, and the ability to build or install programs (for which an internet
connection is a prerequisite).
